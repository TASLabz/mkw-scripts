This file contains information about the Time Difference functions in infodisplay,
as well as the different settings you will find within infodisplay.ini

By default, "Time Difference" is set to "False". When set to "True", Projected and
ToFinish will be displayed. If you wish to display all other calculations, use the
"(Extra)" option. These are not recommended for TASing.

By default, "Comparison Type" is set to "Player" - it has 4 possible values:
	"Player": Which compares the Player against the Ghost (generally the most useful)
	"Ghost": Which compares the Ghost against the Player
	"Ahead": Which compares who is ahead against who is behind
	"Behind": Which compares who is behind against who is ahead
NOTE: Any other value will default to "Player" too.

By default, "History Size" is set to 200. It determines how many frames of history are
stored for certain parts of infodisplay (in Time Difference, it's used for the RaceComp
calculation to store previous race completions). WARNING: If you use a number too large,
it will take up a large amount of your computer's memory.

NOTE: Not all Time Difference calculations are symmetrical, since for most of them, the
speeds and angles of only one of the player and the ghost are considered. This doesn't
make the calculations any less accurate, as it's perfectly normal to have the time taken
for the player to reach the ghost to be different to the time taken for the ghost to
reach the player. As such, we say "Time Difference FROM player TO ghost" or vice versa.

Descriptions for each calculation:

[DEFAULT]

- Projected (P1 -> P2)
	- Returns D / S1 (Speed of P1) where D is the distance represented here:
	  https://blounard.s-ul.eu/iMDYhZDI.png
	- Best general-purpose calculation for non-race-end time difference
	- Forward movement is taken to be the direction P1 is moving
	- As with all but RaceComp, becomes more inaccurate mid-turn

- ToFinish (P1 -> P2)
	- Returns T1-T2 where T is Time taken for a player to cross the finish line if they
	  continue at a constant speed
	- Perfectly accurate approaching the finish line
	- Useless for all non-race-end calculations
	- Symmetrical, as both players are fully considered

[EXTRA]

- Absolute (P1 -> P2)
	- Returns D / S1 (Speed of P1) where D is the distance between P1 and P2
	- Incorrectly assumes "forward" is wherever the other player is
	- Also incorrectly assumes speed is directed towards the other player
	- Will probably be removed in the future; mostly misleading calculation

- Relative (P1 -> P2)
	- Same as Absolute but S1 is the speed of P1 directed at P2, using a dot product
	- Still incorrectly assumes "forward" is wherever the other player is
	- However correctly calculates speed with this "forward" direction in mind
	- So, rarely useful, but at least accurate for some niche scenario

- CrossPath (P1 -> P2)
	- Returns T1-T2 where T are Times taken for a player to cross the other player's
	  path, as so: https://blounard.s-ul.eu/WYbotlks.png
	- Technically accurate long-term, but lacks evolving difference from skewed angles
	- Symmetrical, as both players are fully considered

- RaceComp (P1 -> P2)
	- Returns how long ago P1 was at the race completion of P2 by storing history
	- Accurate only if P1 and P2 take near-identical paths
	- Has a delay of however far ahead P1 is to return an accurate result
	- Takes up a lot of memory very quickly
	- Allows for long distance time difference calculations (not relevant/useful)
	- Symmetrical, as no physical values are used in any calculations
